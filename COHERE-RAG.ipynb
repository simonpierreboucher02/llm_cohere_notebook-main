    "This Python script interacts with the **Cohere API** to generate responses by incorporating **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**. The process uses relevant documents to augment the user query, helping to produce more accurate and contextually aware responses. Here’s a detailed breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Environment Setup**\n",
    "   - **Load API Key**: The script uses `load_dotenv()` to load environment variables from a `.env` file, specifically retrieving the **Cohere API key** (`COHERE_API_KEY`) using `os.getenv()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Document Retrieval (`retrieve_relevant_docs`)**\n",
    "   - **Keyword Matching**: This function searches for relevant documents based on keywords in the user query. The documents that contain any of the query’s keywords are identified as relevant and added to a list.\n",
    "   - **Example**: If the query is `\"What is the debt-to-equity ratio of ABC Corp?\"`, the function searches through the list of documents for terms like `\"debt\"`, `\"equity\"`, and `\"ABC Corp.\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Cohere API Call with RAG (`make_cohere_api_call_with_rag`)**\n",
    "   - **Retrieving Documents**: Based on the user’s query, the function retrieves relevant documents and combines them into a single context.\n",
    "   - **Augmenting the User Query**: The context is prepended to the user’s query to form an **augmented message**. This provides additional context to the model for generating a more accurate response.\n",
    "   - **Conversation History**: The conversation history, including the augmented query, is formatted into Cohere’s expected role-based structure (`USER` for user messages and `CHATBOT` for responses).\n",
    "   - **API Call**: The conversation history (minus the last user message) and the augmented query are sent to Cohere’s chat endpoint (`/v1/chat`) via a POST request. The model used is `\"command-r\"` by default, but it can be customized.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Markdown to HTML Conversion (`format_markdown`)**\n",
    "   - **Format Conversion**: The `format_markdown()` function converts Markdown formatting (e.g., bold, italics, headers, code blocks) into HTML. This ensures that the response content displays correctly when rendered in a Jupyter notebook or HTML page.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Displaying the API Response (`display_api_response`)**\n",
    "   - **Error Handling**: If the API response contains an error, the error message is printed.\n",
    "   - **Response Extraction**: The chatbot response text is extracted along with token usage information (input and output tokens) and additional metadata like chat history and billing units.\n",
    "   - **HTML Formatting**: The response is formatted as HTML using styles for easy readability and then displayed using `IPython.display.HTML()`. The displayed information includes:\n",
    "     - **Token Usage**: A breakdown of input and output tokens used by the API.\n",
    "     - **Response Content**: The assistant’s generated message, rendered as HTML.\n",
    "   \n",
    "### 6. **Example Workflow**\n",
    "   - **User Query**: The user asks, *\"What is the debt-to-equity ratio of ABC Corp?\"*.\n",
    "   - **Document Retrieval**: The `retrieve_relevant_docs()` function identifies the document containing the relevant information: *\"ABC Corp. has a current debt-to-equity ratio of 0.3.\"*\n",
    "   - **Augmentation**: This relevant document is added as context to the query.\n",
    "   - **API Request**: The augmented query and conversation history are sent to the Cohere API.\n",
    "   - **Response**: The chatbot generates a response, which is displayed in HTML format.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of Workflow:\n",
    "1. **User Input**: The user provides a query.\n",
    "2. **Document Retrieval**: The system retrieves relevant documents based on the query.\n",
    "3. **Augmentation**: The user's query is combined with relevant document context.\n",
    "4. **API Call**: The conversation history, along with the augmented query, is sent to Cohere’s chat API.\n",
    "5. **Display**: The response from the API is formatted and displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup allows for more informed and contextually aware responses by integrating external documents with the conversational input, enhancing the capabilities of a typical chatbot."

       "        <div>The debt-to-equity ratio of ABC Corp. is 0.3. This ratio indicates the proportion of a company's assets that are financed by debt compared to equity. In this case, a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.3 suggests that for every $0.30 of debt, ABC Corp. has $1.00 of equity. This is generally considered a healthy and conservative financial position, as it implies the company relies more on equity financing and has a lower financial risk associated with debt. <br>A low debt-to-equity ratio is often favoured by investors as it demonstrates financial stability and the company's ability to manage its debt obligations effectively. It also provides a buffer during economic downturns or periods of financial stress, as the company is less likely to be burdened by high-interest payments. <br><br>In the context of ABC Corp.'s overall financial performance, the low debt-to-equity ratio complements its positive revenue growth, stable net income, and healthy gross profit margin, all of which contribute to a positive financial outlook for the company.</div>\n",
