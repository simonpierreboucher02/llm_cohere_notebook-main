    "This Python code defines a **`ChatBotCohere` class** that interacts with the **Cohere API** to generate conversational responses using a history of conversation and a user-provided prompt. Here’s a detailed explanation of how the code works:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Environment Setup**\n",
    "   - **API Key**: The script loads environment variables from a `.env` file using `load_dotenv()` and retrieves the **Cohere API key** (`COHERE_API_KEY`) with `os.getenv()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Text Generation Function (`generate_cohere_text`)**\n",
    "   - This function sends a request to Cohere’s API for text generation, using the specified parameters:\n",
    "     - **API key**: Required for authentication.\n",
    "     - **Model**: Specifies the model to use (e.g., `\"command-r-plus\"`).\n",
    "     - **Message**: The current user input to which the assistant should respond.\n",
    "     - **Chat History**: A list of previous messages exchanged between the user and the assistant.\n",
    "     - **Preamble**: Provides context or instructions for the assistant (e.g., `\"You are an AI-assistant chatbot.\"`).\n",
    "     - **Temperature**: Controls randomness in the output. A value of `1.0` gives balanced creativity and coherence.\n",
    "     - **Max Tokens**: Specifies the maximum number of tokens (words/subwords) to generate in the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The API request is made via a **POST** request to the Cohere API's `/v1/chat` endpoint.\n",
    "   - The function handles exceptions and returns the API response in JSON format if successful.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **`ChatBotCohere` Class**\n",
    "   - **Initialization**: The class is initialized with the API key and parameters such as:\n",
    "     - **Model**: The Cohere model used for text generation (default: `\"command-r-plus\"`).\n",
    "     - **Preamble**: A context for the assistant's role (default: `\"You are an AI-assistant chatbot.\"`).\n",
    "     - **Temperature**: Controls randomness (default: `1.0`).\n",
    "     - **Max Tokens**: The maximum number of tokens the assistant can generate (default: `2000`).\n",
    "     - **Conversation History**: A list to keep track of the conversation's messages (including roles of `\"USER\"` or `\"CHATBOT\"`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Adding Messages to Conversation History**\n",
    "   - The **`add_message()`** method adds each new message (user input or assistant response) to the conversation history, assigning it the appropriate role (`\"USER\"` or `\"CHATBOT\"`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Generating a Response (`get_response`)**\n",
    "   - The **`get_response()`** method takes the user's input, appends it to the conversation history as a `\"USER\"` message, and sends a request to Cohere’s API using the `generate_cohere_text()` function.\n",
    "   - Once the API returns a response, the assistant’s generated reply is extracted and added to the conversation history as a `\"CHATBOT\"` message.\n",
    "   - The assistant’s response is then returned to the user. If there’s an issue with the response (e.g., missing keys in the API response), an error message is displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Example Workflow**\n",
    "   - A **`ChatBotCohere`** instance is created using the API key and default settings.\n",
    "   - The user inputs the message: `\"Can you suggest 5 dinner ideas for this week?\"`.\n",
    "   - The bot sends the user input to the Cohere API, which generates a response.\n",
    "   - The response is printed, and the conversation continues with the assistant replying based on both the user’s input and the conversation history.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Flow of Execution**:\n",
    "1. **User Input**: The user enters a query (e.g., asking for dinner suggestions).\n",
    "2. **Conversation History**: The query is added to the conversation history.\n",
    "3. **API Request**: The query, conversation history, and preamble are sent to the Cohere API to generate a response.\n",
    "4. **Response**: The assistant’s response is extracted and added to the conversation history.\n",
    "5. **Output**: The response is printed for the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chatbot maintains a history of the conversation and uses that history to produce contextually appropriate responses using Cohere's language models."

      " - 1 teaspoon of dried oregano\n",
      " - 1/2 teaspoon of dried basil\n",

      "5. While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook according to the package instructions until al dente.\n",
