This repository provides Jupyter notebooks for exploring and utilizing Cohere's Large Language Models (LLMs) in various applications, including chatbots and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). These notebooks serve as a practical guide for deploying Cohere models for conversational AI and information retrieval tasks.

## Repository Structure

- **[COHERE-CHATBOT.ipynb](https://github.com/simonpierreboucher/llm_cohere_notebook/blob/main/COHERE-CHATBOT.ipynb)**: Demonstrates the setup of a chatbot using a Cohere model, focusing on creating interactive, conversational exchanges.
- **[COHERE-RAG.ipynb](https://github.com/simonpierreboucher/llm_cohere_notebook/blob/main/COHERE-RAG.ipynb)**: Implements Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), combining document retrieval and generation for contextually relevant responses. Ideal for Q&A systems and customer support applications.
